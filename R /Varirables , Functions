R Programming Language 
This is mainly used in the field of Data Science . 
# is to use to annotote in the R language .
For the R studio we get the output of each of the command wiht the line number and with the Input commad that has been provided. 

Variable in R :
How to store the week in the variabale :
days<- c("Monday" , "tuesday")

# The letter c means the days are collection of the variables that are stored inside this . 
#The <- means the right hand side is stroed in the left hand side part.

For getting the output as Tuesday : the command that has to written as is  :
days(1)

The days in the variable storing is similar to the listing in the python : if we wish to get the output of the above as a list then  :

days[0:1] // both the monday and tuesday will be printed. 
To get the collection of the day as the output then we are supposed to use  :

days<-c("Monday" , "Tuesday" , "Wednesday",  "Thursday" , "Friday" , "Satruday" , "Sunday")
days[c(1,3,5,7)]
 
Ouptut of the above is : Monday , Wednesday , Fridya and Sunday 

Taking out the subset out of days:
#Contianer type is weekdays :

# Printing the subset of days using the print() command
Weekdays<-days[1:5] 
print(weekdays)

Functions in R :

Funtion_name(argument1 , argument2  , argument3 .... argumentn)

The arguments here are the condition that we are asking the R to evaluate . 
Exmaple tio the above is  :

exampleFunction <- function(x,y)
	{c(x+1,y+10)}
#The indentation is very important in the feild of R 

exampleFunction(10,20)

#output of the above is 21,30 collecition of that 
There are some of Built In function in R for for exmple : exp() exponentail function

Built-In functions: 
exp()-> exponential functions 
tan() -> tangents
log() ->logarithms

Some advanced information about these are given in the documentation of R. 
Command to get the information about the Functions  :

Termainal-> ?log()
Termianal -> ?tan()

How to change the base of the log funtion ?
Log(x=12, base =10 )
log(x=100 , base =112)

#using the sepcicification of the  base and the x .
