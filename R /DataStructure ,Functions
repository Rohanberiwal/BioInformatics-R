Functions DataStructures in R 

Core datastreuctures 
months <- array(c("Jan" , "feb" , "march" , "april, "may"  , "june" , "july") , dim = c(3,4)))

The synatx for the array data sturct : array(c(collection function) , lenght/dimentonal value))

The error of the not fully closed paranthesis is shown using the + sign in R. 

The above line of the code creates a marix of 3*4 length that has the input or the paramters as collecion of the name of the months. 

There is difference in teh array and the simple list function   :

months <- c(name of months)
months <-array(c(name  of months) , dim = (1,12))
The first one is a list of name of the months whereas the second one is a 1*12 len sized array . 

Howeveer the matrix can also be formed using the built in function of matrix(data , dim) function :

months_matrix   = matrix(data =c(some name) , dim  =(2,2))
 above is a 2 cross 2 matrix  .

The matrix can also be formed using the matrix(data , row , columns)  functiosn as well .
