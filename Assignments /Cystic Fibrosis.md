# Cystic Fibrosis

## Problem Statement:
Unraveling the complexity of cystic fibrosis through bioinformatics: from identifying novel genetic variants to leveraging multi-omics data for personalized treatment strategies

## Information On Cystic Fibrosis:

1. **Cystic fibrosis (CF)** is a hereditary, autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by defects in the CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) gene.

2. CF is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, located on chromosome 7. The CFTR gene encodes a protein called cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, which functions as a chloride channel regulating the flow of chloride ions across cell membranes.

3. CFTR protein plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance of salt and water in various organs, including the lungs, pancreas, liver, intestines, and sweat glands.

4. When the CFTR gene is mutated, the function of the CFTR protein is impaired, leading to abnormal chloride transport across cell membranes. These mutations can affect different aspects of CFTR protein function, including its production, stability, trafficking within the cell, and activity as a chloride channel.

## How is Cystic Fibrosis Carried Out When the Gene is Mutated?

### 1. Genomic Aspect:

- Mutations occur within the CFTR gene, located on the long arm of chromosome 7.
- The CFTR gene spans approximately 250,000 base pairs and contains 27 exons.
- Mutations in the CFTR gene can occur throughout its coding sequence and regulatory regions, leading to a wide range of genetic alterations.
- The location and nature of the mutation within the CFTR gene can affect its functional consequences.

### Type of Mutation:

- **Missense Mutation:**
  - A single nucleotide change results in the substitution of one amino acid for another in the protein sequence.
  - Can alter protein structure and function.
  
- **Nonsense Mutation:**
  - A single nucleotide change introduces a premature stop codon in the mRNA sequence.
  - Results in a truncated and usually nonfunctional protein.

- **Frameshift Mutation:**
  - Insertion or deletion of nucleotides disrupts the reading frame of the mRNA sequence.
  - Results in changes in the amino acid sequence downstream of the mutation.

### Genetic Aspect:

1. **Autosomal Recessive Inheritance:**
   - Cystic fibrosis follows an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern.
   - Individuals inherit two mutated copies of the CFTR gene, one from each parent.
   - Carriers have a 50% chance of passing the mutated CFTR gene to each of their children.

2. **Heterogeneity of Mutations:**
   - Over 1,700 known mutations in the CFTR gene.
   - Mutations can occur throughout the gene, affecting different regions and functional domains.
   - Severity of cystic fibrosis varies based on specific mutations.

3. **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation:**
   - Specific combination of CFTR mutations influences disease severity and clinical manifestations.
   - Some mutations associated with severe phenotypes, others with milder symptoms.
   - Genotype-phenotype correlations help predict disease outcomes and tailor treatment.

4. **Carrier Screening and Genetic Counseling:**
   - Carrier screening recommended for individuals planning a family, especially with a family history of cystic fibrosis.
   - Genetic counseling provides information about inheritance patterns, reproductive options, and risks to offspring.
   - Understanding CFTR gene mutations crucial for accurate diagnosis, genetic testing, and personalized management.
