# BioInformatics-R
This is realted to my couse on pratical BioInformatics in BIO212 that i did during my undergrad in Computer Science and Eng .

This Repo Covers  :
R language : For viewing the graphs and carrying out the computations .
Sequence Analysis: Understanding and analyzing DNA, RNA, and protein sequences.
Structural Bioinformatics: Exploring the three-dimensional structures of biomolecules.
Genomic Data Analysis: Extracting insights from large-scale genomic datasets.
Evolutionary Biology: Investigating evolutionary relationships through phylogenetics and comparative genomics.
Practical Applications: Applying bioinformatics tools to solve real-world biological problems.

I hope this helps  .
